"""Concatenate the editable src/ partials back into the single-file index.html.

TripleCrown ships as ONE self-contained index.html (works offline from file://, bakes onto a
phone, zero runtime deps). That single file is great for USERS but painful to EDIT, so the source
is kept split under src/:

    src/index.template.html   the HTML shell, with @@CSS_PARTIALS@@ / @@JS_PARTIALS@@ tokens
    src/css/*.css             the stylesheet, split by feature (concatenated in filename order)
    src/js/*.js               the app JS, split by feature  (concatenated in filename order)

Running this script re-assembles index.html. Concatenation (not module bundling) keeps every
function/global in the one shared scope the app + test harness rely on, and the numeric filename
prefixes fix the order so top-level `let`/`const` initialise exactly as before. The output is
byte-for-byte what you'd get hand-editing index.html — nothing about the shipped app changes.

Usage:
    python build.py            # rebuild index.html from src/
    python build.py --check    # verify src/ rebuilds the current index.html (no write); exit 1 if not
